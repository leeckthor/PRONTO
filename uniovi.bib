  abstract =  {Ontologies are viewed as increasingly important tools for structuring domains of interests. In this paper we propose a referenceontology of business models using concepts from three established business model ontologies; the REA, BMO, and e3-value. Thebasic concepts in the reference ontology concern actors, resources, and the transfer of resources between actors. Most ofthe concepts in the reference ontology are taken from one of the original ontologies, but we have also introduced a numberof additional concepts, primarily related to resource transfers between business actors. The purpose of the proposed ontologyis to increase the understanding of the original ontologies as well as the relationships between them, and also to seek opportunitiesto complement and improve on them.},

The product-service system represents a competitive opportunity for many companies as they seek to reduce consumption by altering how their products are used by providing services. To further establish this field, the objective of this paper is to present a literature review on the product-service system, including 149 papers published from 2006 to 2010. The review discusses specific features of the product-service system as well as the benefits and drawbacks that the literature has addressed in recent years. Positive and negative issues of the product-service system are also covered. It is evident that the research in this area is still dominated by theoretical work, and additional empirical research is required. Selected research perspectives are identified that encourage future research. },
